# Optical and SAR  Datasets for Land Use and Land Cover Classification 

This repository provides two co-registered and labeled datasets constructed from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for patch-level land use and land cover (LULC) classification. These datasets are suitable for training and validating machine learning and deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in remote sensing-based classification tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

Each dataset includes:
- 6 LULC classes: Barrenland, Farmland, Forest, River, Sea/Lake, Urban
- 600 image patches per class (64Ã—64 pixels, 10 m resolution)
- Format: GeoTIFF (.tif) with georeferencing metadata
- Total: 3,600 patches per dataset (Optical & SAR)

Each image patch file is named and organized by class for easy access.

## ðŸ›° Data Sources

- Sentinel-2 (Optical) â€” 12 spectral bands  
- Sentinel-1 (SAR) â€” VV and VH polarizations from ascending & descending orbits  
- All patches are spatially co-registered
